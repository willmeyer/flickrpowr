# FlickrPowr

FlickrPowr is a toolset for betterfasterstronger browsing of Flickr.com, for Flickr power users.  

A few years ago, I found myself browsing Flickr extensively but struggling with its interface. I was unable
to effectively scan lots of photos quickly. I also found it difficult to dive into a particular user, group, 
or favorites stream, and return to the point at which I forked off. In other words, the whole browsing experience
was cumbersome and slow, especially when it came to real social discovery.  So I wrote a tool for my own use.

FlickrPowr includes two things:

* A _Browsr_ interface that allows for much faster thumbnail-based browsing of user streams, favorites, contacts, sets, 
  groups, and more, with a simple stack-based paradigm for breadcrumbing your way around.
* A _Framr_ tool for framing individual photos with nice black or white backgrounds   

### YMMV

This is a tool for my personal use, and a total Work In Progress.  You're welcome to try it, its a simple PHP app that will run on most vanilla configs.
