# FlickrPowr

FlickrPowr is a toolset for betterfasterstronger browsing of Flickr.com, for Flickr power users.  

A few years ago I found myself browsing Flickr extensively, but really struggling with the interface when
it came to quickly scanning lots of photos. I also found it difficult to dive into a particular user, group, 
or favorites stream, and then to get back to where I forked off.  In other words, the whole browsing experience
was cumbersome and slow.  So I wrote a tool for my own use.

The toolset includes a few things:

* A _Browsr_ interface that allows for much faster thumbnail-based browsing of user streams, favorites, contacts, sets, 
  groups, and more, with a simple stack-based paradigm for breadcrumbing your way around.
* A _Framr_ tool for framing individual photos with nice black or white backgrounds   

_This is a total Work In Progress_
